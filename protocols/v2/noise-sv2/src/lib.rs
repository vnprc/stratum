//! # Noise-SV2: Noise Protocol Implementation for Stratum V2
//!
//! `noise_sv2` ensures secure communication between Sv2 roles by handling encryption, decryption,
//! and authentication through Noise protocol handshakes and cipher operations.
//!
//! Implementation of the [Sv2 Noise protocol specification](https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/04-Protocol-Security.md#4-protocol-security).
//!
//! ## Features
//! - Noise Protocol: Establishes secure communication via the Noise protocol handshake between the
//!   [`Initiator`] and [`Responder`] roles.
//! - Diffie-Hellman with [`secp256k1`]: Securely establishes a shared secret between two Sv2
//!   roles, using the same elliptic curve used in Bitcoin.
//! - AEAD: Ensures confidentiality and integrity of the data.
//! - `AES-GCM` and `ChaCha20-Poly1305`: Provides encryption, with hardware-optimized and
//!   software-optimized options.
//! - Schnorr Signatures: Authenticates messages and verifies the identity of the Sv2 roles.
//! In practice, the primitives exposed by this crate should be used to secure communication
//! channels between Sv2 roles. Securing communication between two Sv2 roles on the same local
//! network (e.g., local mining devices communicating with a local mining proxy) is optional.
//! However, it is mandatory to secure the communication between two Sv2 roles communicating over a
//! remote network (e.g., a local mining proxy communicating with a remote pool sever).
//!
//! The Noise protocol establishes secure communication between two Sv2 roles via a handshake
//! performed at the beginning of the connection. The initiator (e.g., a local mining proxy) and
//! the responder (e.g., a mining pool) establish a shared secret using Elliptic Curve
//! Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) with the [`secp256k1`] elliptic curve (the same elliptic curve used by
//! Bitcoin). Once both Sv2 roles compute the shared secret from the ECDH exchange, the Noise
//! protocol derives symmetric encryption keys for secure communication. These keys are used with
//! AEAD (using either `AES-GCM` or `ChaCha20-Poly1305`) to encrypt and authenticate all
//! communication between the roles. This encryption ensures that sensitive data, such as share
//! submissions, remains confidential and tamper-resistant. Additionally, Schnorr signatures are
//! used to authenticate messages and validate the identities of the Sv2 roles, ensuring that
//! critical messages like job templates and share submissions originate from legitimate sources.
